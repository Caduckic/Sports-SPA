        <p>Recently we won against Other1, it was a
          long and narrow match. Our players and
          theirs are long time friends so it was a
          very civil and respectful match.
          
          
          Our #1 player Victor Swanson said “Look
          mate it was a great game, had a great
          time with my mates on both sides”, the
          friendship on display is truly admirable.</p>
